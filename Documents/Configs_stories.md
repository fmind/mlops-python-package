## **1. Parse Configuration File**

**Title:**  
As a **developer**, I want to parse configuration files from a specified path so that I can load application settings dynamically.

**Description:**  
The `parse_file` function allows developers to load a configuration file located at a given file path. This enables flexible management of settings across various environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  

- The function accepts a string path to the configuration file.
- It returns an `OmegaConf` configuration object representing the file contents.
- If the file path is invalid or the file format is unsupported, it raises an appropriate error.

## **2. User Story: Parse Configuration String**

**Title:**  
As a **developer**, I want to parse configuration strings so that I can dynamically create configuration objects from text.

**Description:**  
The `parse_string` function allows developers to create a configuration object directly from a string input. This is useful for testing or dynamically generating configurations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  

- The function accepts a string representing the configuration content.
- It returns an `OmegaConf` configuration object.
- If the string is malformed or invalid, an appropriate error is raised.

## **3. User Story: Merge Multiple Configurations**

**Title:**  
As a **developer**, I want to merge multiple configuration objects so that I can combine settings from different sources into a single configuration.

**Description:**  
The `merge_configs` function merges a sequence of `OmegaConf` configuration objects into one, ensuring no conflicting or redundant settings across configurations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  

- The function accepts a sequence of `OmegaConf` configuration objects.
- It returns a single merged configuration object.
- Conflicting keys are resolved using `OmegaConf`'s merging logic.
- If the input is empty or contains invalid types, an appropriate error is raised.

## **4. User Story: Convert Configuration to Python Object**

**Title:**  
As a **developer**, I want to convert configuration objects into Python-native data structures so that I can work with them directly in my code.

**Description:**  
The `to_object` function converts an `OmegaConf` configuration object into standard Python data structures like dictionaries or lists, enabling easy interaction and manipulation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  

- The function accepts an `OmegaConf` configuration object and an optional `resolve` flag (default: `True`).
- It returns the configuration as a Python object (e.g., dictionary, list).
- If `resolve=True`, variables within the configuration are resolved before conversion.
- If the configuration object is invalid, an appropriate error is raised.

---

## **Common Acceptance Criteria Across All Stories**

- The functions are tested with various input scenarios, including valid, invalid, and edge cases.
- Documentation is provided for each function, including usage examples.
- Errors and exceptions are properly handled, with meaningful error messages for developers.
- All functions are integrated into the broader configuration management system of the application.

---

## **Definition of Done (DoD):**

- All functions (`parse_file`, `parse_string`, `merge_configs`, `to_object`) are implemented and tested.
- Unit tests cover valid, invalid, and edge cases.
- Documentation includes clear examples and explanations for each function.
- Functions are robust, handling errors gracefully with meaningful messages.
- Code passes peer review and adheres to the project's coding standards.
