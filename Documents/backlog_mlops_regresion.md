   - **[Metrics](Metrics_storie.md)**: Provide standardized measurements for model performance, accuracy, and evaluation. Useful for tracking improvement and identifying bottlenecks.  
   - **Models**: Define the structure of machine learning models, including architectures and checkpoints, to standardize training and deployment.  
   - **Schemas**: Define structured data formats for input, output, and intermediate processes, ensuring consistency and validation throughout the pipeline.  

2. **Input Outputs**  
   Handle configuration, data ingestion, and external environment variables for seamless integration:  
   - **Configs**: Store and manage configuration files to customize and control the behavior of different modules.  
   - **Datasets**: Handle loading, preprocessing, and managing data sets for training, evaluation, and inference.  
   - **OSVariables**: Provide environment variables and system-level configurations for portability across various environments.  
   - **Registries**: Maintain a central repository for tracking artifacts like models, datasets, and configurations.  
   - **Services**: Connect and integrate external or internal services such as APIs, databases, and message brokers.  

3. **Jobs**  
   Define and manage specific tasks and workflows for various stages in the machine learning lifecycle:  
   - **Base**: The foundational job configurations and implementations shared across all job types.  
   - **Evaluations**: Execute performance tests and comparisons for models, ensuring they meet predefined criteria.  
   - **Explanations**: Generate explainability reports for machine learning models to provide insights into predictions and decisions.  
   - **Inference**: Execute predictions using trained models, optimized for low latency and high throughput.  
   - **KafkaInference**: Specialized inference jobs designed to integrate with Kafka for real-time data streaming applications.  
   - **Promotion**: Automate the promotion of models from development to production environments, ensuring governance and validation.  
   - **Training**: Handle the full model training process, including data preparation, model fitting, and checkpointing.  
   - **Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters and configurations to improve model performance systematically.  

4. **Utils**
