## **User Stories: Global Services**

---

### **1. User Story: Manage Logging Service**

**Title:**  
As a **developer**, I want to have a centralized logging service that captures and formats log entries, so I can keep track of system activities and alerts.

**Description:**  
The `LoggerService` class provides functionality to manage logging in the application using the Loguru library. It allows configuration of log outputs, levels, and formats.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The `start` method initializes the logger with the desired configuration.
- Log entries should show timestamps, log levels, and the source of the log message.
- The logger can be retrieved through the `logger` method.

---

### **2. User Story: Manage Notification Service**

**Title:**  
As a **user**, I want to be able to receive notifications from the application, so I can be alerted about important events or errors.

**Description:**  
The `AlertsService` class provides capabilities to send notifications through the system or display them on the console if notifications are disabled.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The `start` method initializes the notification service.
- The `notify` method allows sending notifications with a title and message.
- When notifications are disabled, messages should be printed to the console instead.

---

### **3. User Story: Manage MLflow Tracking Service**

**Title:**  
As a **data scientist**, I want to manage MLflow tracking and model registry through a unified service, so I can easily log experiments and access models.

**Description:**  
The `MlflowService` class integrates MLflow tracking features, enabling experiment management, automatic logging, and model registrations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The `start` method sets the tracking and registry URIs and initializes the experiment for logging.
- The `run_context` method provides a context manager for tracking runs, allowing easy management of logging during model training.
- Users can retrieve the MLflow client through the `client` method to perform direct MLflow API operations.

---

### **Common Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Implementation Requirements:**
   - Each service class must extend the `Service` base class and implement the `start` method.
   - Clear separation of responsibilities among services (logging, notifications, MLflow tracking).

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Appropriate error messaging for issues encountered during starting services or sending notifications.

3. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests validate the functionality of each service, ensuring they operate as intended when invoked.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Each class and method contains detailed docstrings and usage examples to guide users.

---

### **Definition of Done (DoD):** 

- All required methods in `Service`, `LoggerService`, `AlertsService`, and `MlflowService` are implemented.
- Each service class passes all relevant tests.
- Documentation is clear, and examples are provided for usage.
