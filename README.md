# Install

This section details the requirements, actions, and next steps to kickstart your MLOps project.

## Prerequisites

- [Python>=3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/): to benefit from [the latest features and performance improvements](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html)
- [Poetry>=1.8.2](https://python-poetry.org/): to initialize the project [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and its dependencies

## Installation

1. [Clone this GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) on your computer
```bash
# with ssh (recommended)
$ git clone git@github.com:fmind/mlops-python-package
# with https
$ git clone https://github.com/fmind/mlops-python-package
```
2. [Run the project installation with poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
```bash
$ cd mlops-python-package/
$ poetry install
```
3. Adapt the code base to your desire

## Next Steps

Going from there, there are dozens of ways to integrate this package to your MLOps platform.

For instance, you can use Databricks or AWS as your compute platform and model registry.

It's up to you to adapt the package code to the solution you target. Good luck champ!

# Usage

This section explains how configure the project code and execute it on your system.

## Configuration

You can add or edit config files in the `confs/` folder to change the program behavior.

```yaml
# confs/training.yaml
job:
  KIND: TrainingJob
  inputs:
    KIND: ParquetReader
    path: data/inputs_train.parquet
  targets:
    KIND: ParquetReader
    path: data/targets_train.parquet
```

This config file instructs the program to start a `TrainingJob` with 2 parameters:
- `inputs`: dataset that contains the model inputs
- `targets`: dataset that contains the model target

You can find all the parameters of your program in the `src/[package]/jobs/*.py` files.

You can also print the full schema supported by this package using `poetry run bikes --schema`.

## Execution

The project code can be executed with poetry during your development:

```bash
$ poetry run [package] confs/tuning.yaml
$ poetry run [package] confs/training.yaml
$ poetry run [package] confs/promotion.yaml
$ poetry run [package] confs/inference.yaml
$ poetry run [package] confs/evaluations.yaml
$ poetry run [package] confs/explanations.yaml
```

In production, you can build, ship, and run the project as a Python package:

```bash
poetry build
poetry publish # optional
python -m pip install [package]
[package] confs/inference.yaml
```

You can also install and use this package as a library for another AI/ML project:

```python
from [package] import jobs

job = jobs.TrainingJob(...)
with job as runner:
    runner.run()
```

**Additional tips**:
- You can pass extra configs from the command line using the `--extras` flag
  - Use it to pass runtime values (e.g., a result from previous job executions)
- You can pass several config files in the command-line to merge them from left to right
  - You can define common configurations shared between jobs (e.g., model params)
- The right job task will be selected automatically thanks to [Pydantic Discriminated Unions](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/unions/#discriminated-unions)
  - This is a great way to run any job supported by the application (training, tuning, ....

## Automation

This project includes several automation tasks to easily repeat common actions.

You can invoke the actions from the [command-line](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) or [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dchanco.vsc-invoke).

```bash
# execute the project DAG
$ inv projects
# create a code archive
$ inv packages
# list other actions
$ inv --list
```

# Tips

This sections gives some tips and tricks to enrich the develop experience.

## [AI/ML Practices](https://machinelearningmastery.com/)

### [Data Catalog](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/data/data_catalog.html)

**You should decouple the pointer to your data from how to access it.**

In your code, you can refer to your dataset with a tag (e.g., `inputs`, `targets`).

This tag can then be associated to a reader/writer implementation in a configuration file:

```yaml
  inputs:
    KIND: ParquetReader
    path: data/inputs_train.parquet
  targets:
    KIND: ParquetReader
    path: data/targets_train.parquet
```

In this package, the implementation are described in `src/[package]/io/datasets.py` and selected by `KIND`.

### [Hyperparameter Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization)

**You should select the best hyperparameters for your model using optimization search.**

The simplest projects can use a `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` to scan the whole search space.

This package provides a simple interface to this hyperparameter search facility in `src/[package]/utils/searchers.py`.

For more complex project, we recommend to use more complex strategy (e.g., [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization)) and software package (e.g., [Optuna](https://optuna.org/)).

### [Data Splits](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-test-validation-datasets/)

**You should properly split your dataset into a training, validation, and testing sets.**

- *Training*: used for fitting the model parameters
- *Validation*: used to find the best hyperparameters
- *Testing*: used to evaluate the final model performance

The sets should be exclusive, and the testing set should never be used as training inputs!

This package provides a simple deterministic strategy implemented in `src/[package]/utils/splitters.py`.

## [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

### [Directed-Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)

**You should use Directed-Acyclic Graph (DAG) to connect the steps of your ML pipeline.**

A DAG can express the dependencies between steps while keeping the individual step independent.

This package provides a simple DAG example in `tasks/dags.py`. This approach is based on [PyInvoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/).

In production, we recommend to use a scalable system such as [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/), or [ZenML](https://zenml.io/).

### [Program Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd)

**You should provide a global context for the execution of your program.**

There are several approaches such as [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern), [Global Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable), or [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

This package takes inspiration from [Clojure mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount). It provides an implementation in `src/[package]/io/services.py`.

### [Soft Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softcoding)

**You should separate the program implementation from the program configuration.**

Exposing configurations to users allow them to influence the execution behavior without code changes.

This package seeks to expose as much parameter as possible to the users in configurations stored in the `confs/` folder.

### [SOLID Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

**You should implement the SOLID principles to make your code as flexible as possible.**

- *Single responsibility principle*:  Class has one job to do. Each change in requirements can be done by changing just one class.
- *Open/closed principle*: Class is happy (open) to be used by others. Class is not happy (closed) to be changed by others.
- *Liskov substitution principle*: Class can be replaced by any of its children. Children classes inherit parent's behaviours.
- *Interface segregation principle*: When classes promise each other something, they should separate these promises (interfaces) into many small promises, so it's easier to understand.
- *Dependency inversion principle*: When classes talk to each other in a very specific way, they both depend on each other to never change. Instead classes should use promises (interfaces, parents), so classes can change as long as they keep the promise.

In practice, this mean you can implement software contracts with interface and swap the implementation.

For instance, you can implement several jobs in `src/[package]/jobs/*.py` and swap them in your configuration.

To learn more about the mechanism select for this package, you can check the documentation for [Pydantic Tagged Unions](https://docs.pydantic.dev/dev-v2/usage/types/unions/#discriminated-unions-aka-tagged-unions).

### [IO Separation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/IO)

**You should separate the code interacting with the external world from the rest.**

The external is messy and full of risks: missing files, permission issue, out of disk ...

To isolate these risks, you can put all the related code in an `io` package and use interfaces

## [Python Powers](https://realpython.com/)

### [Context Manager](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html)

**You should use Python context manager to control and enhance an execution.**

Python provides contexts that can be used to extend a code block. For instance:

```python
# in src/[package]/scripts.py
with job as runner:  # context
    runner.run()  # run in context
```

This pattern has the same benefit as [Monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)), a powerful programming pattern.

The package uses `src/[package]/jobs/*.py` to handle exception and services.

### [Python Package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

**You should create Python package to create both library and application for others.**

Using Python package for your AI/ML project has the following benefits:
- Build code archive (i.e., wheel) that be uploaded to Pypi.org
- Install Python package as a library (e.g., like pandas)
- Expose script entry points to run a CLI or a GUI

To build a Python package with Poetry, you simply have to type in a terminal:
```bash
# for all poetry project
poetry build
# for this project only
inv packages
```

## [Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering)

### [Code Typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)

**You should type your Python code to make it more robust and explicit for your user.**

Python provides the [typing module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for adding type hints and [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) to checking them.

```python
# in src/[package]/core/models.py
@abc.abstractmethod
def fit(self, inputs: schemas.Inputs, targets: schemas.Targets) -> "Model":
    """Fit the model on the given inputs and target."""

@abc.abstractmethod
def predict(self, inputs: schemas.Inputs) -> schemas.Outputs:
    """Generate an output with the model for the given inputs."""
```

This code snippet clearly state the inputs and outputs of the method, both for the developer and the type checker.

The package aims to type every functions and classes to facilitate the developer experience and fix mistakes before execution.

### [Config Typing](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)

**You should type your configuration to avoid exceptions during the program execution.**

Pydantic allows to define classes that can validate your configs during the program startup.

```python
# in src/[package]/utils/splitters.py
class TrainTestSplitter(Splitter):
    shuffle: bool = False  # required (time sensitive)
    test_size: int | float = 24 * 30 * 2  # 2 months
    random_state: int = 42
```

This code snippet allows to communicate the values expected and avoid error that could be avoided.

The package combines both OmegaConf and Pydantic to parse YAML files and validate them as soon as possible.

### [Dataframe Typing](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

**You should type your dataframe to communicate and validate their fields.**

Pandera supports dataframe typing for Pandas and other library like PySpark:

```python
# in src/package/schemas.py
class InputsSchema(Schema):
    instant: papd.Index[papd.UInt32] = pa.Field(ge=0, check_name=True)
    dteday: papd.Series[papd.DateTime] = pa.Field()
    season: papd.Series[papd.UInt8] = pa.Field(isin=[1, 2, 3, 4])
    yr: papd.Series[papd.UInt8] = pa.Field(ge=0, le=1)
    mnth: papd.Series[papd.UInt8] = pa.Field(ge=1, le=12)
    hr: papd.Series[papd.UInt8] = pa.Field(ge=0, le=23)
    holiday: papd.Series[papd.Bool] = pa.Field()
    weekday: papd.Series[papd.UInt8] = pa.Field(ge=0, le=6)
    workingday: papd.Series[papd.Bool] = pa.Field()
    weathersit: papd.Series[papd.UInt8] = pa.Field(ge=1, le=4)
    temp: papd.Series[papd.Float16] = pa.Field(ge=0, le=1)
    atemp: papd.Series[papd.Float16] = pa.Field(ge=0, le=1)
    hum: papd.Series[papd.Float16] = pa.Field(ge=0, le=1)
    windspeed: papd.Series[papd.Float16] = pa.Field(ge=0, le=1)
    casual: papd.Series[papd.UInt32] = pa.Field(ge=0)
    registered: papd.Series[papd.UInt32] = pa.Field(ge=0)
```

This code snippet defines the fields of the dataframe and some of its constraint.

The package encourages to type every dataframe used in `src/[package]/core/schemas.py`.

### [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

**You should use the Objected Oriented programming to benefit from [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)).**

Polymorphism combined with SOLID Principles allows to easily swap your code components.

```python
class Reader(abc.ABC, pdt.BaseModel):

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def read(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Read a dataframe from a dataset."""
```

This code snippet uses the [abc module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) to define code interfaces for a dataset with a read/write method.

The package defines class interface whenever possible to provide intuitive and replaceable parts for your AI/ML project.

### [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

**You should use semantic versioning to communicate the level of compatibility of your releases.**

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) provides a simple schema to communicate code changes. For package X.Y.Z:
- *Major* (X): major release with breaking changed (i.e., imply actions from the benefit)
- *Minor* (Y): minor release with new features (i.e., provide new capabilities)
- *Patch* (Z): patch release to fix bugs (i.e., correct wrong behavior)

Poetry and this package leverage Semantic Versioning to let developers control the speed of adoption for new releases.

## [Testing Tricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing)

### [Parallel Testing](https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

**You can run your tests in parallel to speed up the validation of your code base.**

Pytest can be extended with the [pytest-xdist plugin](https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for this purpose.

This package enables Pytest in its automation tasks by default.

### [Test Fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/fixtures.html)

**You should define reusable objects and actions for your tests with [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/fixtures.html).**

Fixture can prepare objects for your test cases, such as dataframes, models, files.

This package defines fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` to improve your testing experience.

## [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### [Code Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces)

**You can use VS Code workspace to define configurations for your project.**

[Code Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) can enable features (e.g. formatting) and set the default interpreter.

```json
{
	"settings": {
		"editor.formatOnSave": true,
		"python.defaultInterpreterPath": ".venv/bin/python",
    ...
	},
}
```

This package defines a workspace file that you can load from `[package].code-workspace`.

### [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

**You can use GitHub Copilot to increase your coding productivity by 30%.**

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) has been a huge productivity thanks to its smart completion.

You should become familiar with the solution in less than a single coding session.

### [VSCode VIM](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)

**You can use VIM keybindings to more efficiently navigate and modify your code.**

Learning VIM is one of the best investment for a career in IT. It can make you 30% more productive.

Compared to GitHub Copilot, VIM can take much more time to master. You can expect a ROI in less than a month.
